## Victoria Black

I am someone who enjoys solving puzzles, with the skills to both work through the low-level technical details of a problem and reflect on the higher-level implications of potential solutions. My undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in philosophy reflect the combination of my strong logical reasoning skills and my passion for reflective consideration of issues, while my passion for coffee drove me to plan a coffee cooperative to support farmers in Ethiopia. I am moving into the tech industry because I want the opportunity to make use of my my problem solving skills and to apply them to software that will make a positive difference.

- TDD
- Git
- Debugging

I am confident using languages that are new to me and I pick these up quickly. For example, there was a group challenge at Makers Academy where we were tasked with making a Facebook clone using Rails, with no prior knowledge or use of it. I took the lead for a lot of the functionality, researched how to do it and then implemented it with a pair. We got everything done relatively quickly and easily.

I am good at sharing my knowledge and understanding. In the Facebook challenge at Makers, I would often take the lead to drive development forward, outlining tasks and organising the workflow. I would take time in our group retros at the end of the day to go through any changes in the code, including changes other pairs had made that day, and explain what each part of the code was doing to the rest of the team. This meant that we all had a good understanding of every aspect of our code, as well as getting a good overview of how to use Rails. Going through and explaining it all really deepened my learning and understanding.

I have a strong background in logic and am good at solving puzzles. During my time at university, I took every available logic module and this was my strongest subject. In my downtime, I spend a lot of time solving logical puzzles, as well as more lateral thinking puzzles like cryptic crosswords, and I've found when I'm solving coding problems that I'm using very similar thought processes and, luckily, having an equally good time doing it. This means I get things done quickly, and will move on to the next task happily without any mental fatigue.
